# Frontend Developer Assignment

As part of our application process, we'd like to see what you can produce by giving you a small assignment. It should take you no more than a few hours to complete the assignment, but any extra polish or features you might want to put in will not go unnoticed.

## Problem Statement

We would like you to create a Distributor Management Progressive Web Application (PWA). A distributor is a person who purchases API keys. These API keys are used to activate the software. The PWA you'll build will be used for distributing API keys. The features it should include:

- Create a new order. Order may contain information about Order Id, the number of API keys required, the details of the Distributor like name, address, PAN card number, etc. (Form Validation is a plus)
- Add notes to the order, including possibly how to pay it, where to send checks, etc.
- Send the API keys via email (does not have to actually send emails, but if it does, great!)
- View previous orders. Dara should be searchable with order Id or date of purchase.

Your backend can be anything, and does not have to work. Even static data in code is ok.

You can use any framework you like, but React will be favourable, as our current product is built using that.

## Requirements -

- Code should have highly reusable components
- Web Page should be responsive for different devices
- Should work perfectly in Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge.

Take your time but try to deliver it within 1 week. If you have any questions, please ask!

To complete your homework, please fork this repo and commit your work to your fork. When you are ready for us to look at it, give us access to your fork (OzoneX, tHeMaskedMan981) so we can review and run it(Add instructions in the README). You can also mail us with the link of github repository. Also, if possible, deploy it to any online platform (eg. Netlify) and share itâ€™s link in the README of your fork.
